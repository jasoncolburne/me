# Education

I'm not going to make headings for this. I did well in school. I didn't really have to try, I just remembered
anything I found interesting and was usually able to derive the mathematical subjects' content from base
principles (Physics is a good example of this).

I won all the Waterloo math competitions in my schools (my high school was only three grades but had 2200
people in it, so coming in first is relevant). I think I came second in my province.

I also won a lot of other science awards my graduating year of high school.

At university I won and placed in two university level mathematics competitions.

I have an Honours Mathematics Degree with a double minor in Physics and Computer Science.
