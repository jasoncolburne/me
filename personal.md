# Personal Life

Later some stuff will appear here about me. I have schizophrenia and may use this space to explain what that
is like, what the medication does, and what my experiences with health authorities have been like. I think
it's important for others to understand my perspective and those of others like me.

Here are some highlights. I:
- Almost failed to graduate university due to depression.
- Wasn't recognized to have schizophrenia until my early 30s.
- Suffered psychosis for several years.
- Have been hospitalized twice, for a month each time.
- Was at one point deep in debt due to renting in an expensive city and being unable to work due to psychosis.
- Lived with my mother in my late thirties during part of my psychosis and recovery. This was difficult for
both of us.
- Have since been medicated (it took three medications and several side effects to find one that was
acceptable) and re-integrated with society.
