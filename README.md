# About me

Welcome! I am a software developer. I've been writing code for over 30 years, since the age of eleven. I've learned a
lot and I'd like to share. You can find links to my `projects` [here](projects.md).

If you are hoping to hire me, I have bad news for you - I rarely reply to recruiters. If the company is one
I actually make use of, I am more likely to allow engagement but I am quite happy in my current role.
Additionally, if I were to switch positions, it's unlikely I'd want to fix or build your Fintech. I like
variety. Check out my interests and projects to understand more of what motivates me.
